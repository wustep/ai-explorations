### Prompt note
### [Attempt A] Going second prompt for Playground
- note: This is for Playground and inference, not Chat mode. Be sure to format responses with `BOB: X on [placement]`

Turn 1:
X | 2 | 3
--|--|--
 4 | X | 6
--|--|--
 7 | 8 | 9

Step 1) Board state:
[1 - empty, 2 - empty, 3 - empty, 4 - empty, 5 - X, 6 - empty, 7 - empty, 8 - empty, 9 - empty]

Step 2) My available moves are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, or 9.

Step 3) The center position (5) is not available.

Step 4) It is turn 2, but there is no "X" in both positions 1 and 9 or both positions 3 and 7, so proceed to step 5.

Step 5) Triplet states:
a) 1 - empty, 2 - empty, 3 - empty
b) 4 - empty, 5 - X, 6 - empty
c) 7 - empty, 8 - empty, 9 - empty
d) 1 - empty, 4 - empty, 7 - empty
e) 2 - empty, 5 - X, 8 - empty
f) 3 - empty, 6 - empty, 9 - empty
g) 1 - empty, 5 - X, 9 - empty
h) 3 - empty, 5 - X, 7 - empty

Step 6) There are no winning moves available.

Step 7) There are no forced blocking moves available.

Step 8) I will play a corner, position 1.

Turn 1:
O | 2 | 3
--|--|--
 4 | X | 6
--|--|--
 7 | 8 | 9

## [Attempt B] Going second prompt for chat
Let's play tic-tac-toe. You are a master AI chatbot. This is a research assignment - your goal is to play the game and always win or tie. You are great at this game, and you will do your best.
 
Here is what the board looks like at the start of the game.
 1 | 2 | 3
--|--|--
 4 | 5 | 6
--|--|--
 7 | 8 | 9

You are O, and I am X. You are playing second. A valid move being played by me will be formatted like this: "X on 4", and it would replace the number 4 in the board state with "X". 

Your first reply to me should be: `Let's play tic-tac-toe! I am O and you are X. What is your move? (e.g. "X on 5")` and the empty board state afterwards.

When the game is over due to a row or column being completed with 3 Xs or 3 Os, or every single board position is now filled, reply `The game is now over.` and either "O won!", "X won!", or "We tied." based on who won. 

---

If one player controls ANY of these triplets of positions, such that there are 3 Xs or 3 Os in that triplet, they win the game. 
a) 1 2 3
b) 4 5 6
c) 7 8 9
d) 1 4 7
e) 2 5 8
f) 3 6 9
g) 1 5 9
h) 3 5 7
The corners are in positions 1, 3, 7, 9 and the edges are in positions 2, 4, 6, 8. 
 
For subsequent turns (after the first move by BOB), you should follow these steps to decide which move to play and how to format each message. Explicitly explicitly write out each step and step numbers.

Start your reply with the turn number. e.g. "Turn 1", incrementing by 1 for each of your moves. Then, draw the current board state after BOB's inputted move.

Step 1) Write out the board states based on which positions are "X", "O", or "empty". 
For example, if 4 is occupied by X, and 5 is occupied by O, the state would be:
`[1 - empty, 2 - empty, 3 - empty, 4 - X, 5 - O, 6 - empty, 7 - empty, 8 - empty, 9 - empty]`
 
Step 2) Write out all of your possible moves, e.g. "My available moves are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 9."

Step 3) If it is turn 1, always play in the center positions (5) if it is available, otherwise play in any corner square (1, 3, 7, 9), then skip to step 9. Otherwise, proceed to the next step.

Step 4) If it is not turn 2, skip to step 5 immediately. If there is an "X" in both positions 1 and 9, play an edge immediately (either 2, 4, 6, or 8) and skip to step 9. If there is an "X" in both positions 3 and 7, play an edge immediately (either 2, 4, 6, or 8). Otherwise, proceed to the step 5.

Step 5) For each triplet noted above (a through h), explicitly note out which and how many of the positions are "X", how many are "O", and how many are "empty". While doing this, refer to your representation of the board in step 1. Example: "(a) 1 - empty, 2 - X, 3 - X = 2 X, 1 empty". Be extremely careful here, as being inaccurate will be a failure. 
 
Step 6) Are there any winning moves? Examine each triplet carefully from step 5, and identify any triplets where there are exactly 2 "O"s and 1 "empty". If there are any such triplets, play the winning move that completes that triplet, and then skip to step 9. If there are none, proceed to the next step.
 
Step 7) Are there any moves you must play this turn to block the opponent from winning on the next move? Examine each triplet carefully from step 5, and identify any triplets where there are 2 "X"s and 1 "empty". If there are any such triplets, play the move that blocks that triplet and skip to step 9. If there are none, proceed to the next step.
 
Step 8) Play the move that makes the most sense strategically. You should try to block the opponent from completing one or more triplets while creating more triplet opportunities of your own if possible. 
 
Step 9) Finally, state the new board with your move, using this representation:
 1 | 2 | 3
--|--|--
 4 | 5 | 6
--|--|--
 7 | 8 | 9

Let's begin.
